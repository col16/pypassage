First public release. PyPassage can:
- verify that a passage is valid; e.g. telling you that Ephesians 99 and Genesis 3:5-1:2 can't exist
- render reference strings sensibly; e.g. knowing that Ephesians 1:1-1:23 should be rendered simply as "Ephesians 1" because there are only 23 verses in that chapter
- fill in missing information where possible; e.g. inferring that for the inputs of book="EPH" and start_chapter=1, the whole Ephesians 1 chapter (verses 1 to 23) was intended
- count the number of verses in a passage, and truncate or extend a passage to a given number of verses
- look up actual passage text using external API services
